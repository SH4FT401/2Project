1	These tense times are making me nervous.
2	Two days ago a young girl was mauled by wild animals in the area.
3	The wild animals are getting more and more aggressive. We should try and kill as many as possible.
4	I'm not in a good mood today. Strangers should best keep out of my way.
5	The last warrior who I killed, begged for his life.
6	Someone has to do something about these stones.
7	I don't trust the peacefulness of the morning.
8	The tension in the air is making me uncomfortable.
9	These arrowheads have been forged very well.
10	If I were you I'd be careful. That arrow is aiming straight for your heart.
11	I should go there and kill one of those beasts.
12	A good martial arts training is essential in these times.
13	The soldiers cannot control the chaos in the country any more.
14	Why are you looking at me like that?
15	Cowards have a small chance of surviving.
16	Don't overestimate yourself.
17	Someone seems to have trained you very well.
18	Even my ancestors managed to assert themselves in battle in these territories.
19	You have to be alert and skilled out here.
20	Don't even think about wasting my time.
21	So, how does it feel to know that your life is in danger?
22	Do you want to give up already?
23	Get prepared to suffer.
24	Oh man! That sword looks fantastic.
25	Be more persistent and increase your power!
26	Do you think you can become as strong as I am?
27	Okay. Let's get serious.
28	Oh my! I'm just a weak woman!
29	You look tired. Why don't you give up already? Hehe.
30	What is Serangyi going to do today, hm?
31	I am so bored. Play with me!
32	I have to say I like the Sura guy most.
33	Hey! How about a fight?
34	Don't underestimate me just because I'm a woman!
35	Pain only lasts a moment...
36	I want to get out of here, at all costs.
37	How safe are the homes of the individual members?
38	Shut up, girls!
39	Let me defeat you. With a single blow.
40	Don't even think about running away!
41	So, why don't we get started?
42	Don't forget: All men are enemies.
43	If a person has a pretty face, we can make an exception...
44	What, you want to fight?
45	It won't take long, but it will hurt.
46	Oh, you really seem to be in pain...?
47	Goodbye! Now go to hell!
48	So, what do you do in the White Oath?
49	Where are you going?
50	Hey, you want to fight?
51	Hehe! You're dodging my hits...?
52	Do you think you can run away from me?
53	Here comes my hit!
54	God, I am so tired!
55	Hey, nice armour! Did it cost a lot?
56	But at least we have nice weather.
57	Oh, you trained a lot! Great!
58	What do you think about my skills? Good, huh? Ha ha!
59	What's up? Oh, you're irritated by my incredible speediness!
60	Why don't I go hunting?
61	Nobody has attacked our village today.
62	If you want to fight, then fight, you bastard!
63	Hehe, you are just a beginner!
64	What should I shoot first, in your arm or in your leg?
65	Here comes my arrow!
66	I have to go to the village and train.
67	I feel so stiff.
68	What's for dinner today?
69	I'm watching, so scream as much as you want.
70	Waited too long? How about swinging that sword of yours!
71	This sword has such a great sound!
72	This sword is ready!
73	Hmm, let's see: Who should this sword kill first...
74	Cut, cut... hair, throats...
75	First, your belly!
76	I'd like to use you as a sheath.
77	I have something for you: eternal sleep!
78	I'm starving.
79	Is there anything to eat?
80	Why am I still hungry after all this food?
81	Aaargh, die!
82	My stomach will decide this fight!
83	It's the choice between heaven and hell!
84	I can't stand it anymore! My body is itching everywhere!
85	Oh yeah. I can see a few pigs!
86	On the ground already?
87	I'll finish you with one hit.
88	That's going to be a great memory!
89	Die!
90	My body has softened.
91	Why don't I train more?
92	Afraid, huh?
93	Ah, another victim of my powerful weapon.
94	Can you see my attack pattern? No? Your loss!
95	Even small cuts can influence your health. Especially if they have come from a mace!
96	Damn, these hands are really impractical.
97	What are you staring at? Never seen someone with an iron fist?
98	You people really annoy me.
99	Do you want me to beat you up? If you don't then run away. Got it?
100	Now watch, I'm going to show you my big hit!
101	Stop staring at my hand!
102	Hey you over there! Do you want to fight? Then come here!
103	I think I'm pretty breath-taking...
104	Why don't we plan something?
105	No, you are not allowed to leave yet. Fight!
106	Ha, there you have it!
107	You're dead meat!
108	Hey, stay here! Play with me!
109	I could carve something nice out of your bones...
110	We haven't trained yet today.
111	Wow, that's great armour! I want to have it.
112	From now on, you will find it hard to ignore my attacks!
113	Ha, ha, ha! Bet you didn't expect that!
114	Beauty isn't everything.
115	Don't stare, fight!
116	I don't like the way that you are staring at me. Come here!
117	It's an honour to die at my sword!
118	Great
119	Hey there, don't touch!
120	Seems like my bowstrings have been cut.
121	Damn, those idiots were here.
122	Not bad. But you are going to die anyway.
123	You're okay with this? That's great!
124	Come here everyone!
125	La, lala, I'm whistling a song...
126	What fantastic weather!
127	Take a deep breath. Don't worry, it's only poison!
128	Great! I appreciate your fighting spirit!
129	Come here! Everybody to me!
130	I'm starving!
131	I have a craving for some fruit.
132	Well, OK fish will do. Attack!
133	Hey, don't run away! Stop!
134	I won. It's obvious!
135	You see? You missed it, haha!
136	You should watch out, haha!
137	Where am I?
138	I'll only leave your face! That'll make a nice decoration...
139	You came to hunt me down? That's ridiculous!
140	You are my next victim.
141	Quite painful isn't it? Well, I'll make it quick.
142	Look at how strong I am: I can swing this huge club!
143	Boring!
144	My whole body is itching.
145	Let's see who's faster.
146	You started it. So don't make me responsible for your death!
147	Once you're in, you won't get out any more. There's no escape!
148	Here comes the last hit. I'll finish you!
149	I've made a yummy new poison. Would you like a taste?
150	I want to see how it works! Here, take it!
151	Hey you there! Come here, do you want to be my test person?
152	I'll poison you!
153	Ah, very good! A guinea pig!
154	It isn't any fun if you give up that quickly! Come on, defend yourself!
155	Wait a moment. I'm looking for something to hunt.
156	It's no use if you move that slowly. Move!
157	Man, I am so hungry!
158	It's great that I've found something to hunt!
159	Let all hope of survival go! You won't survive me!
160	Now you'll find out what real pain feels like!
161	Boooring!
162	I wonder if there's anything we can use as bait?
163	Come and fight if you want to!
164	You want to be a warrior? Then show me what you've got!
165	Wrapped up in silk you'll make a nice appetiser for later...
166	Escape to the village if you want to live!
167	Starving is a pitiful death.
168	Oh, they're coming straight towards us!
169	How about a duel?
170	Don't compare me to those bastards!
171	Here comes my thunder-strike! Ha!
172	Those who run away now are not a real warriors!
173	This time, the poison should work better!
174	When you're hungry, bats are a real delicacy!
175	How about a fight?
176	Once my poison enters your body, there's no cure any more.
177	My magic will burn everything down, hehehe!
178	Burn! Ha, ha!
179	Never forget to sharpen your sword! The next fight is sooner than you think.
180	Feeling faint?
181	Die, and wake up in the afterlife!
182	Defeat me? Are you sure?
183	Fight like a man!
184	Come on, just a little bit more.
185	Ha, I'm looking forward to a nice fight.
186	Fighting is fun, haha!
187	Fight! More and more! Yeah!
188	Ha, very good! Try it again!
189	Look at my sword spinning!
190	You'll regret hitting me!
191	So weak! How ridiculous!
192	I don't want to be disturbed.
193	Go to sleep. Forever!
194	Do you still not want to sleep?
195	There's so much to do! Let's get on with it!
196	Don't let yourself be intimidated by my power, haha!
197	I'll pulverise you!
198	Great, strong opponents last longer! Defend yourself!
199	What? Do you have a problem with my brother?
200	Don't compare me to that beginner!
201	He doesn't like you and I don't like you either!
202	Let's fight.
203	Until death!
204	Look, a butterfly! How pretty!
205	Don't you see the truth of heaven and earth?
206	Later will be too late. You have to believe it now!
207	Believe the doctrine of the esoterics!
208	Those who doubt must die!
209	Get enlightenment by embracing death!
210	The truth of the esoteric belief is understanding the order of heaven.
211	The philosophy of the esoteric belief is the heavenly order!
212	Esoteric truth; truth of the Tiger God; Sabaha Sabaha.
213	You dare to doubt the truth of heaven and earth?
214	There aren't many of us left.
215	Feel my claws!
216	When the truth of the Tiger God is sung for eternity, all suffering will end.
217	They are not the two-legged creatures that are supposed to rule here.
218	Sabaha Sabaha. Send us knowledge!
219	Don't doubt it!
220	Receive the thunder of heaven!
221	Judgement's blow!
222	Hm, it looks like someone has got caught up in my spider web.
223	Esoteric truth; truth of the Tiger God; Sabaha Sabaha.
224	You think I'm a clown don't you? You won't for long!
225	The leader of our sect is a saint and is above all living beings!
226	Burn in the flames of hell!
227	Bet you've never seen such a large tuning fork before, eh?
228	I am a peaceful person. I just don't like being irritated.
229	Is that all that you can come up with?
230	Just because I'm smaller than my brother, it doesn't mean that I'm going to put up with everything!
231	Eternal pain and darkness await you!
232	Nobody can measure up to me!
233	This isn't the end. On the contrary: It can only get better.
234	All we ask for is peace and privacy! Please!
235	If fear overcomes you, put your trust in the Tiger God.
236	The truth of the esoteric faith lies in the order and understanding of heaven.
237	Let's all go to hell!
238	I won't let you go!
239	I'll give you everything I have.
240	I beg you, please save us!
241	Why are people so wet on the inside? That makes my sword go rusty!
242	Has the poison in your sting dried up yet?
243	The gates to hell are wide open. Get in!
244	I'm warning you: Don't force me to use the board!
245	I have seen that you are going to die!
246	Let me think: How can I summarise the order of heaven and earth in just a few words?
247	I can hear the chants of the believers.
248	That's right! Be full of remorse, and you will be rescued!
249	You will suffer eternal pain, because you continue to question the lore.
250	Let me teach you.
251	Don't regard it as pain - see it as a lesson.
252	I might not be pretty, but I have a lot of fun, hihihi!
253	You have to become like us!
254	Come over to us, hihi!
255	Haaa, haha!
256	Here we go!
257	Ahhhhh!
258	We can't do this alone! No!
259	You have to taste the pain, too!
260	How about an exchange? You give me your soul and I'll give you my suffering!
261	You'll find eternal peace soon!
262	Oh, the pain! The pain!
263	Aargghh, damn! My arm's burning!
264	Why do we have to suffer like this? What have we done to deserve this?
265	Suffering from this mysterious disease isn't that bad!
266	Ahhhh!
267	I will kiiiiiiiiiiill you!
268	Don't just watch! Join in!
269	Let's be friends!
270	You are already infected.
271	Now you are my friend.
272	Hihihi!
273	Come here and impale yourself on my arrows.
274	I'm going to infect you with the mysterious disease.
275	Mouth-watering smell!
276	And if I find another cause of the disease...
277	Ha, ha! This'll be fun!
278	Hmm, whip or gripper...?
279	Ahhhhh, yeeeees!
280	Let me pass the disease on to you!
281	This tenacious cause of the mysterious disease!
282	Everyone will die!
283	Small, small, small pieces...
284	There is no escape!
285	The floor will be soaked with your blood. Die!
286	You can beg, but it won't do you any good!
287	You can't hide your fear from me!
288	Death! Death to all people...
289	You miserable pigs!
290	You're starting to make me angry...
291	There will be blood, human.
292	Death and Perdition...!
293	Have you seen the wounds that a spear can rip into your skin?
294	Yes, go on, walk away! We'll see how far you get...
295	Just looking at your shaking hands makes this completely worth my while...
296	You piece of scum dare to challenge me?
297	Death will be your only companion in the future!
298	Your soul will be mine, human!
299	Ah, fresh blood!
300	Looks like another person is going to meet his death here!
301	You should suffer and let out all your anguish...
302	Do you really think that that ridiculous weapon in your hand will be able to protect you?
303	Your courage brought you to me. And now it's going to leave you...
304	If I die, my revenge will follow you for eternity!
305	I will make you die and suffer slowly, very slowly...
306	It will be my pleasure to make you suffer.
307	Your body is shivering like that of a senile old hag!
308	I can smell your fear, little one.
309	I think it is time to relieve you of a few of your body parts.
310	I'm going to send you into your own personal hell!
311	Your pain will drive you insane, before you die...
312	You can wail! You can beg! But it won't do you any good.
313	You're going to experience the worst death you can imagine...
314	Your power is getting weaker. You are already on the brink of death...
315	Are you ready to walk to halls of death for eternity?
316	You should get used to the idea of greeting eternal darkness...
317	Welcome to hell!
318	Scream as much as you like! No one's going to hear you!
319	If you think you can kill me like this... you're more naive than I thought!
320	Not bad, but it still won't be able to save you from your death.
321	Take a look around, this is hell!
322	I'm going peel the skin from your bones.
323	I want to hear you whimper before you die.
324	You know that there's no use hoping, don't you?
325	No, you're not going to die yet. First I want to know how many sword blows your body can handle...
326	Ah, a volunteer...
327	Do you really think that you have even got the smallest chance of escaping?
328	It's not the ground that's moving... it's your knees that are shaking with fear!
329	Welcome to the place in which you will seek your death!
330	I can see the panic in your eyes.
331	Oh, so young and so helpless...
332	We can see every little movement you make.
333	In a hurry? Do you really want to die?
334	Death has already taken its place at your side...
335	Can you hear my bell chiming? It'll be the last thing you hear!
336	I smell blood, lots of it... you won't survive much longer...
337	You can fight... or you can let death embrace you...
338	Why are you here if you want to live?
339	Ah, new bodies for me to destroy!
340	It was your decision to come here, human! And now you'll have to live with the consequences...
341	Our combat strength will never leave us. We cannot die!
342	There's no point in attacking us! You're doomed...
343	Perhaps you will die of exhaustion... or of fear...
344	You have made it here.... and now I'm going to send you to your death.
345	Sacrifice your soul and become one of us!
346	Look at you! Weak and slow...
347	Your body and your soul are mine!
348	Your legs are shaking! Just face it, you're not up to this...
349	How much longer will you be able to handle this?
350	Who could have ever guessed that there is something worse than death?
351	Welcome, death hungry one.
352	You will pay for your indiscretion. With your blood and your soul.
353	After I have destroyed your body, your soul will be mine!
354	How long do you think you can fight me?

402	What nice weather.
403	At the end you will be just as cold as me...
404	You can live forever, at least until the ice melts.
405	How do you think it will feel, when you slowly turn into a piece of ice?
406	Humans...here?!
407	Tired...but awake enough for you...
408	Anybody here, on my hill?
409	You don't belong here!
410	You'd better back off!
411	Stranger... so lonely?
412	It's been a long time since we've seen an experienced fighter around here.
413	Nothing else to do but to wait and polish weapons...
414	Should I work on them?
415	Something is missing. I am not amused...
416	I'm going to put quick end to your pain - and it's the last pain you'll ever feel!
417	A longneck...!
418	Your pale skin is going to get even paler in a minute.
419	You want to challenge me? Fine!
420	You attacked me! You won't survive this!
421	Weak, weak human!
422	Let's see how much you can bear!
423	Got away? Don't even think about it.
424	That's right... comes closer!
425	The sword is shaking in my hand...
426	You won't survive this encounter!
427	Here comes my sword!
428	Painful, isn't it?
429	Even the grass that you're walking on might kill you.
430	I would be careful if I were you...
431	That's right. Come closer...
432	You dare to come near me? Well... then you can live with the consequences!
433	It's time for you say goodbye to the world!
434	Do you regret that you came?
435	Who thinks that they can defeat me?
436	You? You want to fight against me?
437	Attack me, if you dare to!
438	You're not thinking of running away, are you?
439	You have underestimated the coverage of my sword.
440	Are you afraid?
441	I think you're going to die at my hands today.
442	Oh, I like you.
443	Ah, so you want to bring a little bit of variety into my life?
444	Hey! It won't help you to run away like a coward.
445	Has the look of me already made a shiver run down your spine?
446	Don't you want to scream a little?
447	I hope I finish everything in time.
448	Blow on blow and no complaining...
449	This is what a hammer must sound like!
450	Quite hot here.
451	I'm not in the mood for music.
452	My instrument is in a really bad shape.
453	Perhaps I should get a new instrument?
454	My instrument is old and worn... I love old things!
455	I urgently need to find a replacement for the torn strings.
456	I'm so busy!
457	Every day more wounded people arrive here.
458	There's no time for private amusement!
459	And we're running out of medicine.
460	We need someone who can get hold of some ingredients for the medicine.
461	For 30 years, I have been wandering through the mountains with my bow.
462	I supported my wife with this and have raised three children.
463	It's a hard life but worth it.
464	But now, the bowstring has ripped and I can't hunt any more. I can't feed my family like this!
465	If I can't repair this bow, I'll have to buy a new one. But I don't have enough money to do that.
466	Hey, what are you staring at?
467	Stay away from me!
468	How long will I have to keep hiding?
469	Dying alone and forgotten by the rest of the world is not really what I want.
470	Someone has to help me!
471	This day is going to end just like any other day.
472	What can I do now?
473	I never thought it would end like this.
474	I still can't believe that he's not here any more.
475	He didn't deserve that.
476	Another great day.
477	Ariyoung's husband has disappeared.
478	I wanted to help, but this stubbornness...
479	If she had married me, she could have left her boring life behind.
480	Maybe I should have expressed my feelings for her better.
481	Oh no! What should I do if my wife finds out?
482	If only I could just live from reading books!
483	Every book leads you into its own, mysterious world.
484	I know that I can't live like this forever, but...
485	I wish I could change it for my wife, but...
486	Come on, put some effort into it!
487	What are you doing? Can't you hurry up a little more?
488	Just picture a warrior raising his sword and do the same!
489	Where is that fool now?
490	You want to be a man?
491	You seem to be nervous... Don't worry, nothing is going to explode.
492	Sometimes, I just want to go for a stroll.
493	Time is going by so slowly... My grandchildren don't even visit me any more.
494	When you get old, you often don't have much company.
495	My best days are over.
496	The sun is so hot.
497	Wonderful weather to dry laundry, isn't it?
498	Where is that lazy good-for-nothing husband?
499	He's not even ashamed that his children know about laziness! And he calls himself a father...
500	Books, always books! He doesn't go to work and doesn't bring any Yang home. He just reads the whole time!
501	Hello little one, did you sleep well?
502	My little angel.
503	You are my sunshine...
504	What's wrong? Are you hungry?
505	That's right... go to sleep, my little one.
506	Just another day...
507	Where am I going to get food today?
508	It is always the same thing with those sword bearers.
509	Let's see. Maybe I should go to Octavio's restaurant.
510	Oh, by the way, the war seems to be over...
511	The soul of a master potter runs through his fingertips.
512	Ever since the country was submerged into chaos, fighters can be found everywhere.
513	Fights, fights everywhere.
514	I pray for a calm and a peaceful world.
515	Why the hurry? Take a moment to relax and think.
516	Oh my, what should I do?
517	I can't find my brother anywhere, but he did promise to meet me here.
518	And now, all I see here are armed warriors.
519	I miss my brother.
520	Has anyone seen my brother?
521	Ha, this meat is really fresh!
522	It's good that people are eating more meat again now.
523	Business is doing great, but meat is still scarce.
524	When is the meat we ordered going to arrive?
525	If it doesn't arrive on time, we'll have to go hunting.
526	I hope the customers will come in swarms when the weather is this nice.
527	The lazy dog will probably come around soon and he'll want something to eat.
528	Poor guy!
529	He used to be a great warrior.
530	I wonder why he doesn't fight any more?
531	The young guys... so lively and full of beans!
532	Warriors look much more impressive when they are carrying weapons.
533	A murderous mind is something everyone has nowadays.
534	Control your heart, focus your thoughts, and calm your soul.
535	There is no infallible recipe for bliss but some simple guidelines you can stick to.
536	Here, this is a very useful item!
537	Goods from distant countries! Beautiful, extraordinary pieces!
538	Come closer everyone!
539	Come on, people, buy! You won't have this chance again!
540	There are too many thieves around here. They should keep away from my goods!
541	The land has been very dry in the last few years.
542	The grain harvest isn't as good as it used to be.
543	I wonder why the seeds are wasting away on the fields.
544	The grain is brittle and tastes rotten.
545	That's a bad sign. Farming is the foundation of our lives.
546	Rice cakes! Delicious rice cakes!
547	I sell sweet rice cakes!
548	Yeah, business has been pretty bad lately.
549	Maybe I should try it in another city.
550	But there are so many wild predators around here...
551	On days like these, being in a boat is the best thing that can happen to you.
552	Perfect weather for fishing.
553	Now another knot... Right! No fish is going to bite off this hook!
554	That damn bear ruined my fishing pole.
555	I should mend my nets again.
556	Huh!
557	Don't worry about me; that's just how I am.
558	Ha!
559	What should I do so they ... Oh my, what did I say just now?
560	I'm just not brave enough.
561	This axe has served me well for 20 years.
562	Still sharp, though maybe not as good as it used to be.
563	I want to carry on using it, so it needs to be sharpened.
564	I need special mineral stones for that.
565	But where can I get them from?
566	So how about that fighting now?
567	Already exhausted by the heat?
568	I like leaving people behind in the desert.
569	Poor you, buried in the desert like this without any kind of ceremony...
570	I'm going to tell you a secret - I hate dirt!
571	It's quite hot, isn't it?
572	This place is dangerous.
573	I'm going to hit you right between the eyes.
574	It seems like there's something around here for me to mow down.
575	Ah yes, I can see my next prey.
576	I like that, I like that a lot!
577	That one there is nice and fat. That's mine!
578	I love the smell of blood.
579	Not much to kill recently.
580	Hey, these are really fat!
581	The leader will love that...
582	Let's put on our dancing shoes!
583	This arrow is just for you.
584	If I get one, I'll...
585	Hey, what's wrong?
586	Do you think I am easily defeated?
587	Too bad you had to run into me in the desert!
588	Ah, this feeling; I will enjoy it forever!
589	Thanks!
590	I smell humans. What a delicious smell!
591	That's right, come here...
592	I'm so lucky that you got lost and found your way here!
593	Stop!
594	Bit by bit I'm going to rip it out of your flesh...
595	Come closer so that I can scorch your skin.
596	Do you know what kind of pain such a large amount of heat can cause?
597	Perhaps I should cool down my flames with some fresh blood.
598	Your blood... let me taste it.
599	There's no point in putting up a fight.
600	Become like me! Only flames and heat.
601	As long as I'm here, no one will get through here!
602	For some reason, you're starting to annoy me.
603	Do you know where you are?
604	You are quite a pathetic opponent for me!
605	A sword is only useful in the hands of a warrior.
606	Keep the sword in your hand.
607	War is coming.
608	And now we fight until the death!
609	You cannot resist death any more!
610	You will die slowly.
611	Lava is the elixir of life.
612	Lava keeps me alive and will be your death!
613	Isn't it wonderful, this world of glowing lava?
614	You dare to disturb me?
615	You should leave if you value your life.
616	You might regret my presence here.
617	It's a nice day. All I want to do is have some peace and quiet.
618	Nothing compares to the country of Doyyumhwan.
619	A bit of fresh blood would be a nice change.
620	You seem to be seeking your death, otherwise you wouldn't be disturbing me now.
621	Are you already regretting that you turned up?
622	It's too late to run away. Face your fate.
